# Nickels and Dimes Problem
I was asked to solve this problem in an interview once, and couldn't come up with a good solution on the spot. I wrote it
down so I could come back later and figure it out.
> A pile of coins contains only nickels and dimes. Given the total dollars and cents, and the total number of coins,
> determine the number of nickels and the number of dimes.
